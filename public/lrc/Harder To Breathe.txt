[00:00.00](Get ready to sing!)
[00:05.81]How dare you say that my behavior is unacceptable
[00:08.11]So condescending unnecessarily critical
[00:11.91]I have the tendency of getting very physical
[00:15.12]So watch your step ′cause if I do you′ll need a miracle
[00:18.42]You drain me dry and make me wonder why I am even here
[00:21.51]The double vision I was seeing is finally clear
[00:24.62]You want to stay but you know very well I want you gone
[00:27.80]Not fit to ****** tread the ground I am walking on
[00:31.31]When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
[00:37.61]You′ll understand what I mean when I say
[00:39.81]There′s no way We are gona give up
[00:44.00]And like a le girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
[00:50.30]Is there anyone out there ′cause It is getting harder and harder to breathe
[00:56.71]Is there anyone out there ′cause It is getting harder and harder to breathe
[01:03.21]What you are doing is ******** things up inside my head
[01:06.31]You should know better you never listened to a word I said
[01:09.51]Clutching your pillow and writhing in a ***** sweat
[01:12.61]Hoping somebody someday will do you like I did
[01:15.91]When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
[01:22.42]You′ll understand what I mean when I say
[01:24.70]There′s no way We are gona give up
[01:28.92]And like a le girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
[01:35.22]Is there anyone out there ′cause It is getting harder and harder to breathe
[01:41.52]Is there anyone out there ′cause It is getting harder and harder to breathe
[01:59.81]Does it kill
[02:00.60]Does it burn
[02:01.50]Is it painful to learn
[02:03.02]That It is me that has all the control
[02:06.62]Does it thrill
[02:07.21]Does it sting
[02:08.01]When you feel what I bring
[02:09.51]And you wish that you had me to hold
[02:14.12]When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
[02:19.90]You′ll understand what I mean when I say
[02:22.11]There′s no way We are gona give up
[02:26.42]And like a le girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
[02:32.81]Is there anyone out there ′cause It is getting harder and harder to breathe
[02:39.31]Is there anyone out there ′cause It is getting harder and harder to breathe
[02:45.51]Is there anyone out there ′cause It is getting harder and harder to breathe
